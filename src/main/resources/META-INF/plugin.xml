    <description><![CDATA[
    This plugin allows you to quickly switch between your Angular component files, generated by the Angular CLI.
    In fact, all it does is cycling the component extension between .ts -> .html -> .css -> .scss and replacing
    the currently opened file by the next one in the cycle by shortcut.
    This allows you to work quickly and efficiently in a component based manner.

    Note:
    Due to the nature of this plugin it will probably also work with other projects than Angular CLI, as long
    as the files you want to cycle have the exact same and just differ by their extension.
