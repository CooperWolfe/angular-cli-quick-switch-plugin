    This plugin allows you to quickly switch between your Angular component files, generated by the Angular CLI.
    In fact, all it does is cycling the component extension between .ts -> .html -> .css -> .scss and replacing
    the currently opened file by the next one in the cycle by shortcut.
    This allows you to work quickly and efficiently in a component based manner.

    For more details and examples visit the corresponding GitHub repository:
    https://github.com/pkelleter/angular-cli-quick-switch-plugin

    Due to the nature of this plugin, it will of course also work with other projects, that have not been generated by Angular CLI - or are
    not even Angular projects at all - as long as your project structure follows similar patterns (namely all files of a component
    have the exact same path, except for their file extension - and you are cycling between ts, html, css or scss files)
